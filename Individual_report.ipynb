    "The **players.csv** file contains 196 unique players and 7 variables. Key numeric variables are **played_hours** (total play time per player) and **Age** (two missing values). **subscribe** is a boolean indicating newsletter signup (144 True, 52 False). Categorical variables include **experience** (5 levels) and **gender** (7 categories). Computer checks found no duplicate **hashedEmail** identifiers. **played_hours** is highly skewed (mean 5.85 hours, median 0.10 hours, max 223.1). Potential limitations include class imbalance for **subscribe**, small counts in some **gender** categories, and volunteer bias inherent to the data collection method."

    "\n",
    "This question is appropriate because `players.csv` contains all required explanatory variables and a clear binary response variable (`subscribe`). To apply models seen in class, we will likely need to scale the numeric variables, impute the missing values in the age variable, and encode the categorical variables to numeric form."
